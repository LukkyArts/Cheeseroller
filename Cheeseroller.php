/*

Take the price of the chosen cheese, round down to nearest 1000, and add the applicable time penalty/score bonus. 

Example: 
< $1k = -2s
$1k+ = -1s
$2k+ = 0s
$3k+ = +1s 
$4k+ = +2s
$5k+ = +3s - My concern here is that the more expensive cheeses would be nearly impossible to win with. You want an average of 5 seconds each turn and if they're getting a 3 second penalty every turn they need to roll less than 2 every turn. There are 4/20 results that are 2 or less. That's 20% in theory but it feels unfair. This is something that could be tweeked for balance after testing though.
